# docker-sshd-nginx
Dockerfile for building docker container with passwordless sshd server and nginx serving static page. This is mostly a template for creating more useful docker images.

## About

This repository contains all needed resources to build a docker image with following features:
* sshd with passwordless login;
* nginx running and serving simple static page;
* services configured and runnign via supervisord.

For convenience there is a *./manage.sh* command for building, starting (with proper port mappings), stopping and connecting via ssh.

## Why forking the original viliusl/docker-sshd-nginx?

Mainly to apply [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices) in order to optimize the building process and the resulting size of the image
* Ease later changes by sorting multi-line arguments alphanumerically
* Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade -y --no-install-recommends
* Donâ€™t do RUN apt-get update on a single line  (but along with apt-get install)
* Do NOT use DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

As a matter of fact it proved to reduce the image size by a mere 45 Mb for what it's worth.

## Usage
You can download [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/fxmartin/docker-sshd-nginx/) from public [Docker Registry](https://hub.docker.com/).
A bash script is provided: manage.sh, which allows to manage the container, considering that it won't stop by itself due to supervisor daemon:
* start: to start the container
* stop: to stop the container
* build: build the docker image
* ssh: ssh to the container
* web: launch chrome with the IP automatically retrieved from the script

**Run using command:**
```
docker run -d -p 55522:22 -p 55580:80 fxmartin/ubuntu-sshd-nginx
or
manage.sh start
```

**Connect via ssh:**
```
manage.sh ssh
```

Just don't forget to add private key (yeah, I know) from **ssh_keys** folder to you '~/.ssh/' and add it via 'ssh-add'
